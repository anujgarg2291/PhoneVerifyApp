# Phone Validator
This is an iOS application for validating phone numbers using country codes. The app allows users to select a country code from a list, enter a phone number, and validate it using an API. If the phone number is valid, the information is saved in a local database, and the data is fetched and displayed. If the phone number is invalid, it won’t be saved.
